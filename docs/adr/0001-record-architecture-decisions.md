# ADR 1: Record Architecture Decisions

- **Author**: [Józef Daniecki](https://github.com/jdanieck)

- **Status**: Proposed

## Context

As our project grows in complexity and impact, making and communicating architectural decisions becomes increasingly critical. Currently, SceneScape lacks a consistent, transparent process for capturing, reviewing and sharing these decisions. This can lead to misunderstandings, duplicated efforts, and difficulty onboarding new contributors.

Many successful open-source and enterprise projects — including the [Edge Manageability Framework](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-manageability-framework/tree/main/design-proposals) — have adopted Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to address these challenges. ADRs are recognized as an industry best practice for documenting the "why" behind technical choices, ensuring that knowledge is preserved and accessible.

## Decision

We will formally adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADR) as our standard for documenting architectural choices in SceneScape.

ADRs offer a simple, lightweight, and proven format that:

- Makes decisions and their rationale visible to everyone
- Allows to review proposed changes in asynchronous manner
- Reduces the risk of repeating mistakes or revisiting settled debates
- Supports accountability and team alignment
- Streamlines onboarding by providing historical context

This approach is practical, requires minimal overhead, and is easy to maintain. For more details, see [Michael Nygard's article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) and the [architecture-decision-record repository](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record).

## Alternatives Considered

We considered:

- No formal documentation
- Wiki pages or shared docs
- Issue tracker comments

ADRs were chosen for their simplicity, version control, and industry adoption.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Foster a culture of transparency and shared understanding
- Enable us to make better, faster decisions with full context
- Help new team members ramp up quickly
- Provide a clear audit trail for technical choices, reducing confusion and risk
- Align us with best practices used by leading projects

### Negative

- Requires discipline to keep ADRs up to date
- Adds a small amount of overhead to the documentation process
- May require occasional training or reminders for contributors unfamiliar with ADRs
